# OboeAudioRecorder

You might need to set the NDK to the latest version (see screenshot ndk.PNG).

You might need to change "android.enablePrefab=true" with "android.buildFeatures.prefab=true", depending on gradle version used.

You will have to download OBOE sources (zip file included in this repository if needed) and unzip it, and then you will have to change any path to oboe repository by pathes specific to where you have unzipped OBOE sources.

I created this project in order to get skills in Android JNI/NDK/C++ and Google Oboe library.

I was in the process of being recruited by Music World Media so I had to get this type of skills, but the recruiters stopped contacting me (maybe because of this f*cking covid).

It records the audio to a .wav file on the Android device (in the "Recorders" folder).
You can start the recording, leave the app (let it in the background) and it will keep on recording the mic input, even if the Android device is in idle mode. Then you get back to the app, stop the recording, and the wav file is available in the "Recorders" directory.
